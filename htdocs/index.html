									minecraft-anarchy.org delivers a true Anarchy type gameplay experience.</br>
									Cheating and griefing are allowed. There is no kind of build protection anywhere on the server. Admins will only address game breaking issues.
								</p>
								<p>
									Minecraft Anarchy was developed by a group of Minecraft players and technology enthusiasts that became tired of waiting in 2b2t.org's queue. This server was created to provide a lagfree experience that upholds the spirit of minimal intervention into the game. As a matter of course, the map will never be changed.</br>
									<a href="#server">Learn more about the rules</a>
								</p>
								<p>
									The gameplay feels as vanilla as possible while adding only slight enhancements. All plugins running on the server are custom written to reduce lag and to fit their exact purpose. Teleportation with cooldown removes the need to invest hours to travel vast distances while our hourly lottery gives every player a small chance to attain a fortune.</br>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/rules.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><b>ยง1</b> Players must be of full legal age (+18 years old).</p>
								<p><b>ยง2</b> The server admins will address and prevent any behavior that they consider game breaking. This includes, but is not limited to: very fast methods of loading new chunks, extremely overpowered weapons or travel devices, producing lots of lag.</p>
								<p><b>ยง3</b> The server is hosted in germany, which means if you build swastikas or talk xenophobic in chat, the admins will troll you very hard (for an extended period of time, which may ruin your game).</p>
