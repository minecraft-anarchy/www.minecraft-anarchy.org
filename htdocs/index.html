								<h2 class="major">About minecraft-anarchy.org</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Being tired of waiting in the 2b2t.org queue, we decided to host a minecraft anarchy server that is free to join for everyone.</br>
								We wanted a lagfree experience with very little rules and intervention from admins to have the true minecraft anarchy experience.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Connecting</h2>
								<p>The server is reachable via the public Internet at <i>minecraft-anarchy.org</i>.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Spawn gear</h2>
								<p>To make your frist start a good one, each time you are spawned at the world spawn you get:</p>
								<ul>
								  <li>Enchanted leather armor</li>
									<li>Stack of melons</li>
									<li>Iron pickaxe, Iron shovel</li>
								</ul>

								<h2 class="major">Player commands</h2>
								<p>The following commands are available:</p>
								<table style="width:100%">
							  <tr>
							    <th>Command</th>
							    <th>Effect</th>
							  </tr>
							  <tr>
							    <td>/tp spawn | home</td>
							    <td>Teleports you to spawn or home. Can only be used every 10 minutes.</td>
							  </tr>
								<tr>
							    <td>/sethome</td>
							    <td>Sets the location for your home teleport point.</td>
							  </tr>
								<tr>
							    <td>/kill</td>
							    <td>Kills your player.</td>
							  </tr>
							</table>

							<article id="rules">
								<h2 class="major">Rules and Guidelines</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/rules.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><b>ยง1</b> Players must be of full legal age (+18 years old).</p>
								<p><b>ยง2</b> The server admins will address and prevent any behavior that they consider game breaking. This includes, but is not limited to: very fast methods of loading new chunks, extremely overpowered weapons or travel devices, producing lots of lag.</p>
								<p><b>ยง3</b> The server is hosted in germany, which means if you build swastikas or talk xenophobic in chat, the admins will troll you very hard (for an extended period of time, which may ruin your game).</p>
							</article>

							<article id="privacy">
								<h2 class="major">How we protect your privacy</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/privacy.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><b>Your connection information is not shared with others</b></br>The servers firewall is configured to block all but few outgoing connections. This way the minecraft server application is prevented from exporting data about you to to Mojang / Microsoft / others.</p>
								<p><b>Your connection information is not permanently saved to disk</b></br>This servers webserver and minecraft server application is configured to not write to a logfile on disk. Instead, the log messages are written into a pipe, where they can be read by fail2ban or an administrator for debugging purposes. This means that none of your connection data is permanently written to disk on this server.</p>
								<p><b>Proxy servers are allowed</b></br>Connections from VPN or proxy servers are not blocked.</p>
								<p><b>You can review and confirm this yourself</b></br>You can review all the configuration of this server and the code of this website at our open source github repository at <a href="https://github.com/minecraft-anarchy/playbook-minecraft-anarchy">github.com/minecraft-anarchy/playbook-minecraft-anarchy</a>.</p>
